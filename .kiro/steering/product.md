# Product Overview

**Kiro Motion Kit** is a gesture recognition library for Python that enables touchless interaction with applications using computer vision. It provides a framework for detecting both hand gestures (pinch, closed fist, peace sign) and head poses (nod, turn, tilt) via webcam and mapping them to game or application actions.

The library is designed to be framework-agnostic but includes Pygame demo applications showing cursor control and on-screen keyboard interaction driven entirely by gestures.
